## What this project is

Weather Dashboard allows the user to search for a city of their choosing, and returns data showing the following statistics:
* Current Date
* Temperature
* Humidity
* Wind Speed
* UV Index
* 5-Day forecast

It also keeps a list of recently searched cities in the sidebar

## Why I began this project
This was an experiment in parsing 3rd-party API data. I wanted to challenge myself to dig into the source documentation and application console to find how the API information was received, and then format it with my own CSS twist.

## How I implemented this project
This project was implemented by featuring dynamically updated HTML and CSS, powered by JavaScript code. The weather data was pulled from [Open Weathermap's API](https://openweathermap.org/api), and localStorage was used to keep track of recently searched items.

## What I hope to eventually accomplish with this project
I'd like to include a small map that shows local weather conditions as well, though this may be difficult given the limitations of the utilized weather API. Searching by zipcode would also be a nice feature to implement
